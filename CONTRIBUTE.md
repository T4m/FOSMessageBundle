This is the contribute.md of FOSMessageBundle. Great to have you here.
Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

# Contribute.md

## Team members

The initiative of FOSMessageBundle was started by Thibault Duplessis
([thibault.duplessis@gmail.com](mailto:thibault.duplessis@gmail.com)).
The current version separated in two parts (the library and the bundle) was written by Titouan Galopin
([galopintitouan@gmail.com](mailto:galopintitouan@gmail.com)).

## Learn & listen

The easiest way to start with FOSMessageBundle is by reading the 
[documentation](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/tree/master/Resources/doc).

If you want to contribute to this project, please don't hesitate to ask questions on
[Github issues](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/issues) or by emailing me
at [galopintitouan@gmail.com](mailto:galopintitouan@gmail.com)

## Adding new features

The library and the bundle follow PSR-2 as much as possible and as intensively tested.

The best steps to propose a feature are the following:

-   Propose your feature idea in the [Github issues](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/issues)
    to avoid developing something that wouldn't not be merged. Try to explain: your use case (why you need it),
    if it will break Backward Compatibility and if you think you are able to implement it.
-   If your idea is validated and you are willing to implement it, go ahead by creating a Pull Request and
    pushing your changes to it.
-   Try to respect as much as possible PSR-2.
-   Always test as much as possible your code.
-   If there is a Backward Compatibility break, please note it in the Pull Request.

Don’t get discouraged! The response time from the maintainers is usually quite short (a few days at most).

# Bug triage

- Issues and feature requests are tracked in the
  [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/issues).

- You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:
    - Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
    - Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?   
    - Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
    - What tags should the bug have?
    - Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?  

- You can remove duplicate bug reports by posting a message in the dupplicate

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project
built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it
and following some steps.

# Beta testing

Beta testing is essential in FOSMessageBundle to provide a great Developer and User experience.
However, for a beta-testing phase to be successful, it requires a lot of tests in real environments,
in order to complete the library and debug it.

The help of every developer is required here for FOSMessageBundle to become a stable and mature library.

There is for the moment no official roadmap (as the bundle is still under heavy development),
but please don't hesitate to install it and test it as much as possible!

# Translations

For the moment, there are a lot of uncomplete translations: it's an easy way to contribute to
the bundle!

Translations are located here: [Resources/translations](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/tree/master/Resources/translations).
If you speak a language well enough to translate the bundle and are willing to contribute
to the project, you can follow these two steps:

- If the language you speak is already present in the bundle, please chek the two files
  (`FOSMessageBundle.<lang>.yml` and `validators.<lang>.yml`) for mistakes and missing translations.
  If you find such things, please correct them and create a PR!

- If the language you speak is not present in the bundle, please copy the english files 
 (`FOSMessageBundle.en.yml` and `validators.en.yml`) to your files for your language 
 (`FOSMessageBundle.<lang>.yml` and `validators.<lang>.yml`), translate them and create a PR!
 
Here is the current state of translations:

- Arabic: incomplete ✘
- German: incomplete ✘
- English: complete ✔

# Documentation

This section includes any help you need with the documentation and where it can be found.
Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining
it to someone just getting into it. 

- [Help us with documentation here](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/tree/master/Resources/doc)

# Community

This section includes ideas on how non-developers can help with the project. Here's a few examples:

- You can help us answer questions our users have on the
  [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/tgalopin/FOSMessageBundle/issues)
- You write blog posts about FOSMessageBundle, FOSMessage and FriendsOfSymfony in general
- You can write about other people’s projects based on FOSMessage
- You can show your real-world implementation of FOSMessageBundle of FOSMessage.  Show how
  it’s used in daily life. Take screenshots and make videos!
